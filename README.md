## Gatsby and React

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) is just a tool that helps us develop our website without worrying about extraneous stuff. I'm gonna try to use to [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a library that uses Javascript to cleanly build a website/HTML elements. It's pretty straightforward and well-documented. There's probably a lot of 20-min youtube videos that explain the basics well.

Seems like Gatsby Cloud will also easily allow us to host our website online for final presentations.

## How to run this site to test it

The following directions are summarized from [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/#run-your-site-locally).

In the terminal/command prompt:
1. `cd` to the recyclingWebsite directory
2. `> npm run develop`. 
    - If this doesn't work, check the Gatsby documentation link above to troubleshoot.
3. Go to the localhost link provided in the output, probably <http://localhost:8000>. The website should be up and running on this link, ready to be tested.

## Website Features
1. Interactice (?) information session about what can and can't be recycled.
2. A quiz to test knowledge.
3. A tool that uses location data to direct users to their nearest recycling center.
