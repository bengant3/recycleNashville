    'WHY SHOULD YOU RECYCLE?',
    'A lot of people argue that the benefits of recycling do not outweigh the negatives. It can definitely be time consuming and has to be done correctly for it to be effective. However, when done right, it is definitely worth the extra effort. Recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators and conserves natural resources such as timber, water and minerals. It also increases economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials while helping to prevent pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials. It is known to aid in saving energy. Finally, it also supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources while helping create jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries in the United States.',
    'COMMON RECYCLING MISTAKES',
    'Many people attempt to recycle but contaminate their whole bin unintentionally making it unusable. Below is a list of common mistakes and how to minimize them:',
    '1. A container that has food waste on it cannot be recycled in that state, even if it explicitly says that it is recyclable → to solve this problem people should rinse and dry their containers so that they do not have any food one them.',

    'RECYCLING STEPS',
    'An interesting part of recycling is understanding the lifecycle of the objects we recycle. That is, trying to understand how what we put in our bin eventually becomes products we see in stores that say “made out of recycled materials”. The first step of recycling is collection and processing. This can happen through curbside collection, drop off centers, deposit or refund programs, etc. Then these items are sent to a recovery facility to be sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing. Recyclables are then bought and sold like raw materials. Next comes manufacturing, where these recycled materials are turned into new products. The final step in this process is purchasing new products made from recycled materials. Common items made with recycled materials are aluminum cans, carpeting, newspapers, and so much else that we do not realize!',
